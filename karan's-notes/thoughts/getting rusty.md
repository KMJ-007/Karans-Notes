so already learning rust, completed half book(10 chapter), want to get hands more dirty by building things, and for practice i already completed 50% rustlings exercises, all is there on my github,

but want to create things and push and see what i can do and capable of, and learning and breaking things more on the wasm side, so this is something like a list, which i am thinking to complete and learn from them more

and there is one condition whatever is done, needs to be blog, doesn't matter how ammature it is, but it needs to be done


- [writing lisp interpreter](https://vishpat.github.io/lisp-rs/)
- game of life
- cellular automatan
- maybe [[manage my download folder mess]] can be done in rust(tauri) also ?
- ray tracer
- gameboy emulators(tiny memory, but they can play any game they want)
- CRDT
- operating system([blog,](https://os.phil-opp.com/)[playlist](https://t.co/JyjZZJNYFv))(you can go ahead one more step and make a webos, people don't need to download it they can interact it from the website itself)
