##### what ?

my download folder or temp folder is messy, it is just all kinds of things, from movies, images, music, every possible garbage is there

like i want something app where i just give the dir where all my mess is, and press button, and it should just do the magic, like if i want more advanced adjustments like, i want music to be more sorted according to the artist, or if can't organise this thing just dump them in useless things, or like if you found any files which are older than that i want to delete them

so it should create a delete folder and, latter i can go through them if i want to delete them or not


like when i do the changes it should ask for the confirmation like this are the results, i can check them and go through them, if i like i can just one click to write, may be provide settings if i want this as default, to directly write, will make little laggy

##### how ?

embeddings will come very handy in this, open ai provides embedding with large context window, and there are lot of other services which provides, 

and there was this very cool research paper which was like can search through any files

also you can do very cool things with .ds__folder, you can create whatever kind of structure you want, so that would be also nice easter or one more thing which i would like in this
