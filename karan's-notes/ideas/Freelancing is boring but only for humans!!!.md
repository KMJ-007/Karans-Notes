##### what ?

I have lot of friends who does freelancing, the biggest pain for them is doing revisions, and sometime it takes lot of time to do the work, and there is bidding system in major all freelancing platforms, so ai can do both better than humans, it can beat both by providing unlimited revisions and providing work as fast, like i have so much confidence that it can do web scrapping task with more accuracy than human, with use of multimodal


##### how ?

so creating AI agent, which have browsing access, it can do great job, but for more accuracy i think gpt-4 vision model can be hooked up, to get more accurate result, and some kind of reward function, and chain of thought can be provide to pass context to another agent for some specific task, provide some intial money to setup and boost the account, creating basic portfolio setup for looking it more authentic, and let it run for while, see and improve it!
