inspired by [near](https://near.blog/my-favorite-links/), This page contains some of my favourite links, which in some way i keep revisiting them on internet, some are blog, video, etc.., it is just that others similar to me can find and enjoy this, i have tried to categories them as possible.

this is living post, i keep updating the new links.


[paul graham](https://twitter.com/paulg): pg is the guy behind the famous [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/), he his very famous for his essays, and startup advices and mentorship on the internet, i like his few essays but more than that i love him because without him, [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) wouldn't exist, and i got introduced to lisp :)
