I Was listening to debate between hotz and Eliezer(i don't know how to read or write the name, i am sorry but i copied it from google), i have been consuming both's work, have little bias towards hotz, he makes little sens to me maybe because i/people(may be) like rebellious people than normal, the other guy seemed talking much in jargons and heavy words, like trying to prove something, he has already arrived on the decision, that himself he don't know, whether we should go for singularity or not to save humanity, maybe i am wrong, and i also don't know a thing that much, he has spend so much time in all this,

but i learned few things i heard about diamond nano bots, i seen them in star trek episode, but it was like i heard the word first time maybe because it was diamond nano bots, but i agree to the point of hotz that, conflicts only happen when two entity wants same resources, it can be humans, animals or any thing, even process in operating system, we have mutual exclusion, job scheduling algo and other lot of things to avoid the conflict, 

probability seems that machine will fight machine, and as human we will enjoy watch them, this is how htoz said, and i felt then, but as i am writing now, i think it can be machine vs human because of resources, unless we find resources which are not conflict, what i am saying is machine also want energy, and we also want that same thing to sustain, forms can be different, and energy can be only transferd, machine will try to do the same thing, it will do anything, which can put us in harm, they will use our resource to fulfil their, it seems little sci-fi, and it is little, so solving AGI/SINGULARITY seems as humans finding some kind of reliable energy source or moving us to new energy source, both will take some time, dyson sphere will take much longer, but until then we shouldn't stop our progress in new tech, we will take care when the problem will come, if we are not able, fittest will win

bio stack and silicon stack both are great words and topic, when i think about bio stack, i think about as bio stack if we exit the simulation, if we are in one, than this will become the same machine vs humans problem in just different context, the creator will face new kind of paradox and challenges, but my guts says bio stack is much more powerful and capable then silicon stack, it is just that we haven't made that much progress in bio stack sector, we are still waiting for that transistor movement in bio stack which can move things faster, whereas in silicon we have already started to max out things, like this thing reminded me of evangelion's [MAGI](https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Magi) where silicon and bio stack are merged together,
