Things/topic/area which I like to explore and make some things & experiment:

- Writing lisp compiler in ts, rust and go(why lisp, because in language you can modify it's own code and write another compiler, if i manged to do that, that means i have somewhat understanding of language, [watch this](https://youtu.be/OyfBQmvr2Hc?si=pZbQRH7ejnYUownv) 
- Exploring CRDT and implementing, and understanding it from bottom, how can we push multiplayer experience to the max
- Building ray tracer and playing with webgl and shaders
- Experimenting with wasm, what are the crazy things can be done using wasm(using rust to do that)
- Playing with automaton, sand simulation(creating Tetris game)
- Experimenting with AR/VR, apple’s is very good in this space, seeing what are the possibility and can be done
- Writing and playing with emulators firmware(learning by writing one)
- Playing with version control systems(git is the most beautiful software ever made, how can we use it else or what are the other possibility that we can use maybe alternative history)

- Experimenting and making something for following industry, making things which don’t exist yet or will be very useful and there is chance that it can become building block in the future(pick any one but do one at a time):
    - Defense(there needs to one global defense system which protects us from destroying each other from, there is higher chance that we destroy ourselves than some other aliens destroy us)

    - Space (there needs to be federation and we want to be part and making universe a better place)
    - renewable/ reusable resource/energy ( why are fighting or killing each other, there are limited things which we can consume, but there is abundance, we just need to figure out how to transform it, and make self sustainable cycle)
    - Government open source initiative(biggest inspiration is singapore goverment, india needs to learn and adopt we can have much bigger impact and growth as collective than individual)
    - HCI(what are the new ways we can interact with computer interfaces)
    - Commerce(trading things is basic and most fundamental, how can we make it more easy to do, what are the belief debt which we are taking with us, reimagining things, it can be e-commerce or any new way)
    - How we socialise on the internet(there needs to be more way we can socialise on the internet, how and who we make friends with, what is history of human being social animal)
    - How bits and atoms can be joined( the intersection is very interesting and good, imagine plants talking with us and we talking with them, and we both understand each other, sharing emotions with wild life, unifying individual consciousness into one consciousness, can plants become our friends and share what they are feeling with us, like how people do with dogs and cat, can we extract memory or experience from bio stack to silicon or direct connection, i am experiencing how other animal perceives or feels about the world or certain feelings)
    - Bio stack(creating life and new things using bio stack, creating programable bio life, creating bio stack language, how cool it would be to create things which interact with each other, and evolve and love and create cycle of life)
    - transportation(if we are able to alter the atoms and rearrange them it would be very efficient way of transporting things from one place to another, same for consciousness, like imagine i want to go to mars, i don't need to get in any space or anywhere, my consciousness is transformed into light or any other form which is more easier to transform, one beam of light travels from earth to mars and i am there on the mars, i can be any body i like, i like the idea of traveling without any restriction, our body is also comes in some sort of restriction, if we can become something which is beyond this body we can do things more efficiently)

adding things as i learn and my thoughts evolve
