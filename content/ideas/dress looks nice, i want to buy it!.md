##### what ?

you know my mom/sister/masi whenever they go out, this is common, that girl is wearing really good dress, i saw a similar one on the amazon or xyz, or in this if it was yellow color, it would be really nice, you got what i am trying to say

so the solution can be done in lot of medium, the simplest one, who is not that tech savy, is just forward dress photo to whatsapp, and bot will reply with the product links, which are in stock and can be bought, you can also say yellow dress or something specific, and it will match the style of the image photo but pick up the color yellow and show the results according to it

this can be also made shopify plugin, simple inbuilt search, just click image what you are looking for, describe it and it will show you the results

##### how ?

so all the game is of embeddings, the closest and something working prototype of is made by Karina, really great, all working as it should be, like pinterest but what i want is i get them

she used open ai clip on the dataset which she created from few stores, but as of now there are lot of cheap and efficient way of doing the embeddings at scale, and fully automated, 

there are already open source solutions for image embedding search just use both text and image
