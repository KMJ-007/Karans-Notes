Imagine you never have to work for just to get food on your table, world hunger  will be no more problem in the world, human can focus on more important problem and creative work.

You will say then how are we are going to get food to survive ?

Same as plant gets, a guy said from the future.

So let's deep dive in this possibility:

Let's first understand how Photosynthesis work, and what is it, I don't want to sound boring but, it is actually interesting, 
>Photosynthesis basically means that they are able to [synthesize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis "Chemical synthesis") (make) food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. 

So by doing the magic at the end they are producing [glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose), and human digestion system breaks down food into glucose and our cells store the energy as a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The magician here is [chloroplast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast) , which is present in the plants, not in humans :(

So what is stopping us, many other species other than plants also uses Photosynthesis [read](https://phys.org/news/2011-01-physicists-outer-shell-hornet-harvest.html) [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11214)

In the future let's say we somehow managed to biohack human body, we are able to have magician [chloroplast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast) in our body, so that means we solved world hunger, right ?

No, huh?

practically it is not possible, because unlike plants we have more complex system, brain, and we also can walk, so we need more energy to run our body.

even by using Photosynthesis, we would produce only 1% of the daily energy requirements for the person to survive. To live on photosynthesis alone, the human would need a green body with the surface the size of a tennis court.

okay, but let's say we somehow build more advance version of chloroplast in future, which is more efficient and less in space, so we don't need long body size of tennis court.

human's are now seen on the beaches, and in the outside world more, mom's no longer says, your dinner is ready, they say go outside if you are hungry, mom are more happy because they no longer have to cook daily, eventually our body will turn in green ([interested to know why?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730/) )

but with the time we will lose the ability of Photosynthesis, because it is not efficient for humans, because, we have more efficient ways to make food for our human body.

Then why plants didn't loose through the evolution, because plant can't walk, they can't go to their food directly, they can expand their roots but to some level only, not like humans who can go to one continent to other in search of food.

We can't solve world hunger problem using this method, but we will need to solve it as soon as possible, so human can work on better problems in the world.

I had first thought about this when i was in 6th grade, and one of the recent discussion with friend about this topic lead me to write this blog.
