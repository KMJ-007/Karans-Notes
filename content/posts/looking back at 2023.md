There are still lot of days left to 2023, but i know myself, reflection and writing about this takes time, because i need to think, go back again relive those moments again to feel them back, i got to know about how hard it can be reflecting whole year while filling [year compass](https://yearcompass.com/), it is like you done and gone through lot of things but it feels like you haven't done anything, everything is same like nothing special, but it is special for the last year's Karan, which is normal for present Karan.

I think i should start from where i started my year, i come from delhi on 1st jan, from the best hackathon ever [epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com/), made lot of new friends, learn about lot of new things, there was this overflowing ambition in the environment, new people, and little imposter syndrome, but it was net net more positive, i still don't realise how big it is deal to travel solo, maybe i didn't give that much attention to it, met this young girl working at tcs gandhinagar own flight, see was amazed that i travel and managed my self solo at this age, from ahmedabad to delhi, and back again, she was telling she needs to ask for permission to everything, and still can't manage all by herself, don't know why but it don't bother me that much, like rn if i want to go anywhere solo, i can manage myself, just needs some money, so kind of that is big progress one can say, where in 12th i was little scared to go out and and meet people, i liked my own shell and space more, but there was this hunger.

I came across [genuary.art](https://genuary.art/), and was interested in doing it, i thought it was very good medium to express and it was cool i liked it, but here is the thing, to know about what you are interested or not in anything, there is this initial time, where you have to put some time, discipline, to see do you really like it or not, better example would be picking up book which you thought interesting, but you never pick up that book and read even the first chapter or anything, and just made assumption that it is not for me, but you have to at least give time to know about more, that's what exactly happened, when i had motivation and that rush, i created repo, and started to day dream, but never even done one single sketch tbh, i just did one very one small p5 sketch, which is just me fooling my self that i am doing something, fooling yourself is very easy.

in the early jan i tried meta quest, thanks to het, and with our wonderful friend vivek, we all experienced 4th dimension using VR, it was lot of fun, i played VR cricket, and really enjoyed it, i got very optimistic vibe after trying it, the tech is so promising, like i was talking with krishna, about [ready player one](https://youtu.be/cSp1dM2Vj48?si=VDJgDsnliulDNHtw), and i generally think it still far in the future, but there are still things are missing, which i would like in this, haptic feedback is there, but computer are still not able to perceive [what is smell like](https://www.osmo.ai/), what is touch like, what is sensation, when we achieve this, we become god for another simulation which we will eventually get created by this, we are loosing little track here but let's get back the main focus.

so like till 2022 i was the person who generally thought all the outcome/result will in the binary, either you get get pass or fail, you get yes or no, it was all around me, i grew up like this, and still i think most of it are like this, but thanks to viraj, he suggested me to watch [Code Geass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass), it is one of the great old anime out there, i was so into it that in week completed 2 seasons, i learned about this new term called [grey area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_area) , there are situation where you can't say who is villain or hero, who is bad guy or who is good guy, it varies from the person to person, and it is very thin border, and there are lot of situation like this, from multiple angle all character seems whatever they done is right even if it seems wrong, and sometime in life lot of situation it is like that, all don't understand, like very good example of this is movie [Drishyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drishyam_(2015_film)), and one more observation is that lot of Japanese anime still hold that usa vs japan.

In mid jan i meet again my school friends riddhi and dev, like after 7 year, it was really good talking with them, and catchup with them, and thing i learned or observed is all the people are into interpersonal fights like whoever i met, and whichever problem they are facing, it is the biggest and hardest problem for them, it may look easy for other and seems ye kya rota rehta hai itni si baato par, but look from this pov, for small child, being hungry and crying and wanting food is the struggle for him, but as we see him we just say, how easy life it is, no school, no homework, all things are getting served, what a great life, but all are doing there best at their stage.

also two things which i still want to do, one is to learn dance and playing any musical instrument, i tried salsa, gone to 2-3 events, and beginners class, but all the stars don't align at the same time, and i know it is upto me to align them, but that general thought is, there is lot of time, will do it latter, btw it really increases your chance of meeting new friends, creating new friends and dating in general through this kind of activities, like if we meet in the group of new people, i can't start talking about my computers and nerd stuff, this things are really good for ice breakers and increasing surface area for luck, if you are looking for partner or friends.

at the end of jan, me and my little brother shiven had accident, i drifted his electric scooter at speed of 30 and  managed to get his arm broken and my whole face chiseled, because of adlerian rush, we didn't feel the single thing at that time and we were laughing at each other, but after that it was lot of pain, but my hands are still in excellent condition, so nothing can stop me from picking up my laptop.

So right after back to work after travel, i was all in, in [smart agent](https://online.smartagent.one/), in period of jan-may in old legacy code base, i alone created more than 200 small & big PRs, and around 500 commits to the code base, fixed and improved lot of features, which looked small but were show stopper in someway, like pdf headers to small details, i worked on everything which was need at that time, i was not focused to solving any specific area of problems, you keep throwing at me, i will get them complete, it looked normal for me than but now looking back at this number, i don't know how this much happened, i still remember i was with friends for birthday of friend, i am literally traveling and phone comes, i carry my laptop everywhere, people are taking photo, enjoying [atal bridge](https://sabarmatiriverfront.com/atal-bridge/), and i am in the middle of the bridge fixing the bug, and pushing it and merging all in just 10 mins.
