>Right now, this page is a bit all over the place with my casual story, random hobby ramblings, and some quirky interests. I'm still figuring out how to organize it all.


I got into computers back in 6th grade, learned about C and Linux. It was the good old days when I'd come home from school, download new Linux distros (like Kali Linux, Parrot, etc.), and mess around with them. I'd play GTA Vice City, download pirated games, and even attempt to boot iOS on my mom's old phone (which mysteriously disappeared). I had computer access thanks to my dad, a luxury many of my friends didn't have.

I learned programming and started creating projects in my 12th, i got my first freelance project for creating site using ghost, and it was first money self earned, after that i also got internship offer from same guy, learned full stack development in just 2.5 months through [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), i also discovered [hackclub](https://hackclub.com/) the same year, and truly it was one of my life changing moment.

I got very close to getting my admission canceled from clg, because i made website for students without asking for any permission for any copyright, which i don't regret!

Hobbies:

I like to read sci fiction books, binging hackernews articles and reddit, i am little introvert so i struggle with new peoples in first meet, but as i get familiar with you, i will open like onion, layer by layer!

i have very good bonding with people who love to explore things by their curiosity, or they love their work that they can't stop talking about it
